% Extending File Type icons

Font-Awesome includes some great file type icons, like _fa-file-word-o_, but when using the font programmatically, these classes are not as helpful as if the classes relied on the actual file extensions, like _fa-file-**doc**-o_ or _fa-file-**docx**-o_.

The following jsfiddle example shows how you can edit or override the css to include these classes as well as a JavaScript example of how this can be used.
